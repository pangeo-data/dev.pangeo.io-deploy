This directory contains the files that will be used to run the lab
exercises for the CUAHSI Virtual University Snow Hydrology course.

Note that you should not save any files in this examples directory,
as it will get overwritten when we release new files for later homework
assignments. Instead, you will want to save all your files in the directory

/home/jovyan/work

(note that "jovyan" is your username in your own cloud instance)


The files needed for the various homework assignments will be in the directories

/home/jovyan/homework_0
/home/jovyan/homework_1
/home/jovyan/homework_2

These directories will become available as the course progresses.
